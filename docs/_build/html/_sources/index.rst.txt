   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Google Season of Docs 2020
==========================

Objectives
----------

1. To produce high-quality, versioned end user documentation by consolidating large
   amounts of information from disparate sources and re-writing
   information for clarity, consistency, and completeness. Documentation
   should be easy to understand for beginners, without being patronizing
   to tech-savvy users.
2. To create a documentation portal using a static-site generator.
3. To future-proof end user documentation by creating templates and
   detailed how-to instructions for future open source contributors.

Areas of focus
--------------
New users often look for a quick start guide to get going as quickly as possible. While the install of ScummVM can be complex on some platforms, installing it onto a computer is not. 

The quickstart guide should cover the following:
 - How to install ScummVM onto Windows, Mac and Linux. 
 - How to load, add and launch a game. 

In cases where the install is not intuitive, or where the user may not have a strong technical base, the user needs a comprehensive guide for installing ScummVM on any of the supported platforms

The comprehensive installation page should cover the following:
  - Any system requirements/prerequisites. 
  - How to download the appropriate version of ScummVM. 
  - How to install ScummVM. 
  - How to load games onto the chose platform, especially where it is not the platform the game was designed for. 
  - How to launch ScummVM, add a game, and launch a game.


Existing users need reference documents that explain how to use ScummVM.

The reference documents should cover the following: 
 -  The Launcher interface; What each window and tab looks like as well as how they function.
 -  An explanation of the available settings, both global and game-specific.
 -  Keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys.

Advanced users need additional behind-the-scenes options to tweak how their games run, including how to report any bugs.

While our documentation will be versioned, having a Release Notes section may be     helpful to provide a summary of changes in the latest releas. This may include some areas which are currently outside the scope of this documentation, such as newly supported games or information about new engines.  

Wherever possible, I will use screenshots, gifs, and other visual aids to enhance understanding.

Plan of attack
--------------

I propose to start by creating a template for the ‘Installing ScummVM’
pages, as that will be the easiest way for me to get the information I
require from port maintainers/developers (especially where this
information is scant or does not exist). I will pre-fill any information
I already have from existing documentation, which can then be checked
for completeness, accuracy, and currency, or added to as necessary.

Next I will comb the existing documentation; readme, wiki and website.
As I go, I will re-write and add to each section as required and pull
all the information into the new portal. I will also make note of what
information is pulled from where, to ensure that once the portal is live
there are no double-ups, contradictions, or other anomalies.

Throughout, I will liaise with the mentor(s), developers, port
maintainers, and any other subject matter experts to source any missing
information, as well as ensuring each page is as up-to-date and
comprehensive as possible.

In the spirit of collaboration and subject to approval from the
mentor(s), I would like to have the work-in-progress portal accessible
to the ScummVM community throughout the writing process, to receive
real-time feedback and ensure nothing is missed along the way.

I suggest using a style guide (such as the Google developer
documentation style guide) to ensure consistency for this body of work,
and all documentation moving forward.

Writing samples
---------------

This prototype documentation portal shows how I intend to complete this
project if I am selected. Its secondary purpose is to serve as a sample
of my writing ability.

The Raspberry Pi installation guide was written from scratch. The other
sections were pulled from existing documentation, but have been edited
and rewritten as required.
